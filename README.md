# bjjdata

Organizing links to clips of submissions with metadata

# Why make another bjj db?

I saw bjjheroes, tapology, drub.co, bjjcollective, and they were all out of date or difficult to browse. It's hard to curate useful data. It needs to be a community effort.
But when the data is privately held, there is no incentive to contribute. So I thought I'd try and organize an open source collection of bjj data.

It's not just mine. It's MIT licensed, so you can copy this repo to make this data yours if you like.

# Goals

While I enjoy instructional videos, it's hard to judge if the advice is sound. High level competition results don't lie.

So this repo is initially focused on curating timestamped YouTube links to submissions in competitons involving athletes who have won world championships.

# How to use the data on your site

# How to add a clip to this site?

Your contributions are welcome.

1. Look at this [example file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubershmekel/bjjdata/main/data/2022/galvao-servio-1.md).

2. Browse to the correct year's folder, for example https://github.com/ubershmekel/bjjdata/tree/main/data/2022

3. Create a new file ![create a new file](https://i.imgur.com/mBYvYtK.png) using the button at the top right.

4. Name the file [first-name-person1][first-name-person2]-1.md, add the contents similarly to the example file.

5. Make sure the submission clip time starts just 2-3 seconds before the submission is starting to lock in, so we can see the entry.

6. Make sure the submission clip time ends just 2-3 seconds after the tap, so it's clear to see there was a tap.

7. Then click "propose new file" and create the pull request.
